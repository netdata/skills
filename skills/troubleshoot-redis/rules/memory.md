# Redis: Memory signals

## Scope

Signals in the Memory domain for Redis, as defined in the Netdata operator playbook. Each signal
includes a short description, the collection source, and a hint for the MCP query pattern that
surfaces it. Use this file during a triage pass to decide which signal to pull first.

## Severity legend

- **HIGH**: first-class paging target. Short time to impact.
- **MEDIUM**: ticket-worthy. Usually a precursor, not a cause.
- **LOW**: context only. Useful for RCA, not for alerting.

## Signals

### Memory Usage Ratio [HIGH]

The ratio of allocated memory (`used_memory`) to the configured memory limit (`maxmemory`).

Collection source: `INFO memory` then `used_memory` `CONFIG GET maxmemory` then the configured limit

MCP query: pull this signal with `query_metrics` and check the last 15 to 30 minutes against
expected bands. Cross-reference with `find_anomalous_metrics` scoped to the same context. Use
`find_correlated_metrics` if the signal has moved but the obvious cause is not visible.

### Memory Fragmentation Ratio [HIGH]

The ratio of OS-reported resident memory (`used_memory_rss`) to Redis-tracked allocated memory
(`used_memory`).

Collection source: `INFO memory` then `mem_fragmentation_ratio`

MCP query: pull this signal with `query_metrics` and check the last 15 to 30 minutes against
expected bands. Cross-reference with `find_anomalous_metrics` scoped to the same context. Use
`find_correlated_metrics` if the signal has moved but the obvious cause is not visible.

### Evicted Keys Rate [HIGH]

The rate of keys removed due to the `maxmemory` limit being reached.

Collection source: `INFO stats` then `evicted_keys` (cumulative counter; compute rate of change)

MCP query: pull this signal with `query_metrics` and check the last 15 to 30 minutes against
expected bands. Cross-reference with `find_anomalous_metrics` scoped to the same context. Use
`find_correlated_metrics` if the signal has moved but the obvious cause is not visible.

### Copy-on-Write Memory During Fork [HIGH]

The amount of additional memory consumed by the child process during RDB save or AOF rewrite due to
copy-on-write page duplication.

Collection source: `INFO persistence` then `rdb_last_cow_size` (after last RDB save) `INFO
persistence` then `aof_last_cow_size` (after last AOF rewrite) Real-time proxy: `used_memory_rss`
spike during `rdb_bgsave_in_progress` = 1 or `aof_rewrite_in_progress` = 1

MCP query: pull this signal with `query_metrics` and check the last 15 to 30 minutes against
expected bands. Cross-reference with `find_anomalous_metrics` scoped to the same context. Use
`find_correlated_metrics` if the signal has moved but the obvious cause is not visible.

### OOM / Write Rejection Errors [HIGH]

Rate of write commands rejected due to memory limit (`maxmemory` with `noeviction` policy) or
persistence failure (`stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes` with failed RDB save).

Collection source: `INFO stats` then `total_error_replies` (cumulative counter; compute rate) `INFO
errorstats` (Redis 6.2+) then per-error-type counters, e.g., `errorstat_OOM:count=N`

MCP query: pull this signal with `query_metrics` and check the last 15 to 30 minutes against
expected bands. Cross-reference with `find_anomalous_metrics` scoped to the same context. Use
`find_correlated_metrics` if the signal has moved but the obvious cause is not visible.

## Triage order within this domain

Investigate HIGH-severity signals first, then MEDIUM, then LOW. HIGH-severity signals have the
shortest time to impact; a confirmed HIGH anomaly usually justifies paging. When two HIGH signals
move together, treat them as one incident until `find_correlated_metrics` rules out shared cause.

## Common false positives

- A single stale data point from a collector restart triggers many signals briefly. Re-query after
  30 seconds before escalating.
- Short bursts under 60 seconds rarely warrant action unless paired with a confirmed business
  impact.
- Comparing against yesterday's baseline on a post-deploy day produces false anomalies. Compare
  against the pre-deploy baseline.
- Collector-visible percentile latency with < 100 samples per minute is noise. Require a minimum
  sample count before acting.

## Remediation pointers

Remediation for signals in this domain is tech-specific and typically covered in the operator
playbook's SECTION 3 (Failure Patterns) or SECTION 4 (Runbooks). Before applying a change:

1. Run the MCP verification queries to record the current state.
2. Apply the smallest remediation that addresses the confirmed cause. Config changes before
   restarts; restarts before rollbacks.
3. Re-run the same MCP queries after the remediation settles. Recording before/after numbers is how
   a runbook entry gets sharpened over time.

## MCP query examples for this domain

```text
# Pull every signal in this domain at once
query_metrics with contexts=[<signals from the list above>] and relative_window=-30m

# Ask the agent to rank anomalies that match this domain
find_anomalous_metrics filtered by any attribute unique to the Redis service (usually service.name or host.name)

# Look for correlated signals outside this domain
find_correlated_metrics around the incident window, limit 15
```

## When to escalate out of this skill

If none of the signals in this domain move during the incident, the root cause is elsewhere. Typical
re-routing:

- Host-resource domain: load, CPU, memory, disk, network saturation
- Dependency domain: the service's upstream or downstream (database, cache, queue) is the actual
  source
- Orchestrator domain: Kubernetes or systemd lifecycle events rather than application misbehavior
- Alert engine domain: a misconfigured alert threshold triggered a false-positive incident
