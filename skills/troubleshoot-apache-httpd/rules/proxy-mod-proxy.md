# Apache HTTPD: Proxy (Mod_Proxy) signals

## Scope

Signals in the Proxy (Mod_Proxy) domain for Apache HTTPD, as defined in the Netdata operator
playbook. Each signal includes a short description, the collection source, and a hint for the MCP
query pattern that surfaces it. Use this file during a triage pass to decide which signal to pull
first.

## Severity legend

- **HIGH**: first-class paging target. Short time to impact.
- **MEDIUM**: ticket-worthy. Usually a precursor, not a cause.
- **LOW**: context only. Useful for RCA, not for alerting.

## Signals

### Backend Response Time [HIGH]

Time for backend servers to respond to proxied requests.

Collection source: - Access log: `%D` includes backend time + client transfer - Error log: proxy
timeout messages - External: direct curl to backend

MCP query: pull this signal with `query_metrics` and check the last 15 to 30 minutes against
expected bands. Cross-reference with `find_anomalous_metrics` scoped to the same context. Use
`find_correlated_metrics` if the signal has moved but the obvious cause is not visible.

### Proxy Error Rates (502/503/504) [HIGH]

Rate of proxy-specific error codes.

Collection source: - Access log: 502, 503, 504 status codes - Error log: AH01114 (proxy connection
failure), AH00898 (bad status line), AH00484 (MaxRequestWorkers)

MCP query: pull this signal with `query_metrics` and check the last 15 to 30 minutes against
expected bands. Cross-reference with `find_anomalous_metrics` scoped to the same context. Use
`find_correlated_metrics` if the signal has moved but the obvious cause is not visible.

### Backend Member Health [MEDIUM]

Availability status of individual backend servers in mod_proxy balancer pools.

Collection source: - `balancer-manager` endpoint (if configured) - Error log: backend-specific
failure messages

MCP query: pull this signal with `query_metrics` and check the last 15 to 30 minutes against
expected bands. Cross-reference with `find_anomalous_metrics` scoped to the same context. Use
`find_correlated_metrics` if the signal has moved but the obvious cause is not visible.

## Triage order within this domain

Investigate HIGH-severity signals first, then MEDIUM, then LOW. HIGH-severity signals have the
shortest time to impact; a confirmed HIGH anomaly usually justifies paging. When two HIGH signals
move together, treat them as one incident until `find_correlated_metrics` rules out shared cause.

## Common false positives

- A single stale data point from a collector restart triggers many signals briefly. Re-query after
  30 seconds before escalating.
- Short bursts under 60 seconds rarely warrant action unless paired with a confirmed business
  impact.
- Comparing against yesterday's baseline on a post-deploy day produces false anomalies. Compare
  against the pre-deploy baseline.
- Collector-visible percentile latency with < 100 samples per minute is noise. Require a minimum
  sample count before acting.

## Remediation pointers

Remediation for signals in this domain is tech-specific and typically covered in the operator
playbook's SECTION 3 (Failure Patterns) or SECTION 4 (Runbooks). Before applying a change:

1. Run the MCP verification queries to record the current state.
2. Apply the smallest remediation that addresses the confirmed cause. Config changes before
   restarts; restarts before rollbacks.
3. Re-run the same MCP queries after the remediation settles. Recording before/after numbers is how
   a runbook entry gets sharpened over time.

## Netdata contexts that surface Proxy (Mod_Proxy)

No Netdata-native contexts were classified into the Proxy (Mod_Proxy) domain for Apache HTTPD. Use
discovery-style MCP calls below, or consult the full context list in SKILL.md.

## MCP query examples for this domain

```text
# Discover contexts for this service
list_metrics with q="apache-httpd"

# Rank anomalies on the host running this service
find_anomalous_metrics with node=<host>
```

## When to escalate out of this skill

If none of the signals in this domain move during the incident, the root cause is elsewhere. Typical
re-routing:

- Host-resource domain: load, CPU, memory, disk, network saturation
- Dependency domain: the service's upstream or downstream (database, cache, queue) is the actual
  source
- Orchestrator domain: Kubernetes or systemd lifecycle events rather than application misbehavior
- Alert engine domain: a misconfigured alert threshold triggered a false-positive incident
