# Kubernetes Cluster State: Pod Lifecycle signals

## Scope

Signals in the Pod Lifecycle domain for Kubernetes Cluster State, as defined in the Netdata operator
playbook. Each signal includes a short description, the collection source, and a hint for the MCP
query pattern that surfaces it. Use this file during a triage pass to decide which signal to pull
first.

## Severity legend

- **HIGH**: first-class paging target. Short time to impact.
- **MEDIUM**: ticket-worthy. Usually a precursor, not a cause.
- **LOW**: context only. Useful for RCA, not for alerting.

## Signals

### Pod Readiness [HIGH]

Whether pods are in a Ready state; passing their readiness probes and able to serve traffic. This is
distinct from pod phase: a pod can be Running but not Ready.

Collection source: - Metric: `kube_pod_status_ready{condition="true"}` (from kube-state-metrics,
STABLE) - API: Pod status conditions

MCP query: pull this signal with `query_metrics` and check the last 15 to 30 minutes against
expected bands. Cross-reference with `find_anomalous_metrics` scoped to the same context. Use
`find_correlated_metrics` if the signal has moved but the obvious cause is not visible.

### Pending Pods [HIGH]

Number of pods in Pending phase, indicating they cannot be scheduled or started.

Collection source: - Metric: `kube_pod_status_phase{phase="Pending"}` (STABLE)

MCP query: pull this signal with `query_metrics` and check the last 15 to 30 minutes against
expected bands. Cross-reference with `find_anomalous_metrics` scoped to the same context. Use
`find_correlated_metrics` if the signal has moved but the obvious cause is not visible.

### Container Restart Rate [HIGH]

Rate of container restarts across the cluster, indicating application or infrastructure instability.

Collection source: - Metric: `kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total` (Counter, STABLE) - Labels:
`container`, `namespace`, `pod`

MCP query: pull this signal with `query_metrics` and check the last 15 to 30 minutes against
expected bands. Cross-reference with `find_anomalous_metrics` scoped to the same context. Use
`find_correlated_metrics` if the signal has moved but the obvious cause is not visible.

### CrashLoopBackOff Count [HIGH]

Number of containers in CrashLoopBackOff state; they are crashing repeatedly and kubelet is backing
off on restarts.

Collection source: - Metric: `kube_pod_container_status_waiting_reason{reason="CrashLoopBackOff"}`
(STABLE)

MCP query: pull this signal with `query_metrics` and check the last 15 to 30 minutes against
expected bands. Cross-reference with `find_anomalous_metrics` scoped to the same context. Use
`find_correlated_metrics` if the signal has moved but the obvious cause is not visible.

### Stuck Terminating Pods [HIGH]

Pods with a deletion timestamp that have not been fully removed, indicating stuck finalizers, volume
teardown failures, or kubelet issues.

Collection source: - Metric: `kube_pod_deletion_timestamp` (from kube-state-metrics, STABLE);
compare with current time - API: `kubectl get pods` shows "Terminating" state

MCP query: pull this signal with `query_metrics` and check the last 15 to 30 minutes against
expected bands. Cross-reference with `find_anomalous_metrics` scoped to the same context. Use
`find_correlated_metrics` if the signal has moved but the obvious cause is not visible.

## Triage order within this domain

Investigate HIGH-severity signals first, then MEDIUM, then LOW. HIGH-severity signals have the
shortest time to impact; a confirmed HIGH anomaly usually justifies paging. When two HIGH signals
move together, treat them as one incident until `find_correlated_metrics` rules out shared cause.

## Common false positives

- A single stale data point from a collector restart triggers many signals briefly. Re-query after
  30 seconds before escalating.
- Short bursts under 60 seconds rarely warrant action unless paired with a confirmed business
  impact.
- Comparing against yesterday's baseline on a post-deploy day produces false anomalies. Compare
  against the pre-deploy baseline.
- Collector-visible percentile latency with < 100 samples per minute is noise. Require a minimum
  sample count before acting.

## Remediation pointers

Remediation for signals in this domain is tech-specific and typically covered in the operator
playbook's SECTION 3 (Failure Patterns) or SECTION 4 (Runbooks). Before applying a change:

1. Run the MCP verification queries to record the current state.
2. Apply the smallest remediation that addresses the confirmed cause. Config changes before
   restarts; restarts before rollbacks.
3. Re-run the same MCP queries after the remediation settles. Recording before/after numbers is how
   a runbook entry gets sharpened over time.

## MCP query examples for this domain

```text
# Pull every signal in this domain at once
query_metrics with contexts=[<signals from the list above>] and relative_window=-30m

# Ask the agent to rank anomalies that match this domain
find_anomalous_metrics filtered by any attribute unique to the Kubernetes Cluster State service (usually service.name or host.name)

# Look for correlated signals outside this domain
find_correlated_metrics around the incident window, limit 15
```

## When to escalate out of this skill

If none of the signals in this domain move during the incident, the root cause is elsewhere. Typical
re-routing:

- Host-resource domain: load, CPU, memory, disk, network saturation
- Dependency domain: the service's upstream or downstream (database, cache, queue) is the actual
  source
- Orchestrator domain: Kubernetes or systemd lifecycle events rather than application misbehavior
- Alert engine domain: a misconfigured alert threshold triggered a false-positive incident
